To run this code, download the Assignment 2 folder and then execute the following in the command line:

`main.rb ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt [name of final report].txt [depth number]`

The report I have generated is from running it with a depth of 2.  I would not run this with a depth greater than 3 as this could start to take a very long time to run!
